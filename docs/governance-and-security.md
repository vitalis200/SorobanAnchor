## Governance Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Maintainer** | Reviews and merges pull requests, cuts releases, manages the GitHub repository settings, and holds admin keys for testnet deployments. |
| **Contributor** | Submits pull requests, opens issues, and participates in design discussions. All contributors must follow the project's code of conduct. |
| **Security Reviewer** | Performs security-focused review of changes that touch authentication (SEP-10), key management, contract upgrade paths, or cryptographic primitives. At least one security reviewer must approve any such change before merge. |
| **Attestor** | An on-chain role registered via `AnchorKitContract::register_attestor`. Attestors are vetted off-chain before their Stellar public key is submitted for registration. |

### Decision-making

- Routine changes (bug fixes, documentation, non-breaking feature additions) require **one maintainer approval**.
- Breaking API changes, contract upgrades, or changes to the security model require **two maintainer approvals** and a 48-hour review window after the PR is opened.
- Disputes are resolved by maintainer consensus; in the event of a tie the repository owner has the casting vote.

## Contract Upgrade Policy

SorobanAnchor is deployed as a Soroban smart contract on the Stellar network.
Contract upgrades are intentionally restricted to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Who can approve upgrades

Only the **admin address** recorded in the contract's persistent storage at
initialization time (`AnchorKitContract::initialize`) may invoke upgrade-related
entry points. This address is a Stellar account controlled by the project
maintainers.

### Upgrade procedure

1. A maintainer opens a pull request with the proposed contract change.
2. The PR must pass all CI checks (`cargo test`, WASM build, `validate_bundle.sh`).
3. Two maintainer approvals are required (see Decision-making above).
4. The WASM artifact is built reproducibly via `make release` and its SHA-256
   checksum is published in the release notes.
5. The upgrade transaction is constructed offline, reviewed by a second maintainer,
   and broadcast only after both parties have verified the checksum matches the
   published artifact.
6. The upgrade is announced in the project's release notes with a summary of
   what changed and why.

### Rollback

If a deployed upgrade introduces a critical regression, the admin address can
re-deploy the previous WASM artifact. The previous artifact's checksum is always
retained in the release archive under `dist/`.

---

## Admin Key Management

- The admin Stellar account uses a **multi-signature** setup: at least 2-of-N
  signers must co-sign any admin transaction (N ≥ 3 for mainnet deployments).
- Admin secret keys are **never committed to the repository**. The `.gitignore`
  excludes `*.secret`, `*.key`, `.env`, and `secrets/` directories.
- Testnet admin keys are rotated after each major release cycle.
- Mainnet admin keys are stored in an offline hardware wallet; no single person
  holds all signing keys.
- Key rotation follows the same two-maintainer approval process as contract
  upgrades.

---

## Dependency Auditing

All Rust dependencies are pinned to exact versions in `Cargo.toml` and
`Cargo.lock` is committed to the repository so builds are reproducible.

### Audit process

- `cargo audit` is run in CI on every pull request (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
  Any advisory that is not explicitly ignored causes the build to fail.
- New dependencies require maintainer review. The reviewer checks:
  - Is the crate actively maintained?
  - Does it have a history of security advisories?
  - Is the functionality available in an existing dependency?
- The `soroban-sdk` and `stellar-xdr` crates track the Stellar Protocol version
  in use. Upgrades to these crates are treated as contract upgrades (see above).

### Supply-chain hygiene

- Dependency updates are submitted as dedicated PRs so their diff is easy to
  review in isolation.
- The CI pipeline verifies that `Cargo.lock` is up-to-date and that no
  `[patch]` overrides point to unreviewed forks.

## Security Practices for Contributors

### General

- **Never commit secrets.** Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
  The pre-commit hook in `scripts/pre_deploy_validate.sh` scans for common
  secret patterns before allowing a commit.
- **Validate all inputs.** Every anchor domain or URL must pass
  `validate_anchor_domain` before use. Every SEP response must be validated
  through the `response_validator` module.
- **Use the type system.** Prefer `Result<T, AnchorKitError>` over panics.
  Panics in contract code cause the entire transaction to abort; use
  `AnchorKitError` and propagate errors explicitly.

### Cryptography

- Do not introduce new cryptographic primitives without a security review.
  The project uses Ed25519 (via `soroban-sdk`) for SEP-10 JWT verification.
- Nonces and replay-protection timestamps are validated in
  `AnchorKitContract::submit_attestation`. Do not bypass these checks.

### SEP-10 authentication

- JWTs are verified on-chain using the anchor's registered Ed25519 public key.
  The signing key is sourced from the anchor's `stellar.toml` and must pass
  domain validation before being stored.
- Token expiry is enforced; expired tokens are rejected with
  `ErrorCode::InvalidSep10Token`.

### Rate limiting

- All attestation submission paths are protected by the `RateLimiter` module.
  Do not remove or weaken rate-limit checks without a security review.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not open
a public GitHub issue**. Instead:

1. Email the maintainers at the address listed in the repository's `SECURITY.md`
   (if present) or contact the repository owner directly via GitHub's private
   vulnerability reporting feature
   (`https://github.com/onjehdaniel889-ctrl/SorobanAnchor/security/advisories/new`).
2. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and an
   assessment of impact.
3. Allow up to **72 hours** for an initial response and **14 days** for a fix
   to be prepared before public disclosure.
4. We will credit you in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** model: the fix is merged and deployed
before the vulnerability details are made public.

## Incident Response

1. **Triage** — The maintainer who receives the report assesses severity within
   24 hours and notifies the full maintainer team.
2. **Containment** — If the vulnerability is exploitable on a live deployment,
   the admin address is used to pause or restrict the affected entry points
   while a fix is prepared.
3. **Fix and review** — A patch is prepared on a private branch, reviewed by
   at least two maintainers, and tested against the full CI suite.
4. **Deployment** — The fix is deployed following the contract upgrade procedure
   above.
5. **Post-mortem** — A public post-mortem is published within 30 days describing
   the root cause, impact, and remediation steps.
