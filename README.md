# SorobanAnchor

A Soroban smart contract SDK for Stellar anchors. Handles attestation management, SEP-6 deposit/withdrawal flows, SEP-10 JWT authentication, anchor routing, rate limiting, and transaction state tracking — all in a `no_std` Rust library compiled to WASM.

## What it does

- Registers and revokes attestors with SEP-10 JWT verification
- Submits and retrieves on-chain attestations with replay attack protection
- Normalizes SEP-6 deposit, withdrawal, and transaction status responses across anchors
- Verifies SEP-10 EdDSA JWTs on-chain using stored Ed25519 public keys
- Routes requests across multiple anchors by reputation, fees, and settlement time
- Caches anchor metadata and stellar.toml capabilities with TTL-based expiry
- Tracks transaction state transitions with full audit logging
- Propagates request IDs and tracing spans across operations
- Enforces rate limits and configurable retry/backoff strategies
- Validates anchor domain endpoints and response schemas

```

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

For WASM output (Soroban deployment):

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

## CLI

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
anchorkit deploy --network testnet

# Register an attestor
anchorkit register --address GANCHOR123... --services deposits,withdrawals,kyc

# Submit an attestation
anchorkit attest --subject GUSER123... --payload-hash abc123...

# Check environment setup
anchorkit doctor
```

## Key APIs

```rust
// SEP-6: normalize a raw anchor deposit response
let response = initiate_deposit(raw)?;

// SEP-10: verify an anchor JWT on-chain
contract.verify_sep10_token(token, issuer);

// Submit an attestation (replay-protected)
let id = contract.submit_attestation(issuer, subject, timestamp, payload_hash, sig);

// Route across anchors by lowest fee
let best = contract.route(options);

// Track transaction state
tracker.transition(tx_id, TransactionStatus::Completed);
```

## Configuration

Anchor configs live in `configs/` as JSON or TOML. Validate them with:

```bash
./scripts/validate_all.sh
```

Schema reference: `config_schema.json`

### Attestor Roles

SorobanAnchor supports 13 specialized attestor roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities. For detailed information about each role, their permissions, and usage examples, see:
